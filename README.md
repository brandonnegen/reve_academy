Client project for Reve Academy
Reve Academy Application
Explanation of Project

Reve Academy (reveacademy.org) partnered with Prime Digital Academy for our group's final client project. There were four of us who worked over the course of three weeks on the application. Reve Academy is currently going through the accreditation process and needed a way to collect and analyze data. Reve Academy needed an application that the staff could use to save, edit and delete information related to their organization to a database. They also needed a way to visualize data through charts and graphs. Additionally, they required a separate user log in for teachers affiliated with the organization to input data as well. Their previous solution had been to use paper and pen. This project successfully met all of the requirements listed above.
